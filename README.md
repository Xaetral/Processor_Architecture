# Processor Architecture

This document aims at explaining what really is a processor in the simplest way possible.

## 1. Numbers

You may think that a processor is built from transistors and logic gates, but there are many counter examples out there.
To fully explain the whole picture we need another level of abstraction.  

When it comes to processors and similar modern components, you often hear the terms "numeric" and "digital".  
This hints us what processors are really made out of: numbers, that are themselves made out of digits.  

So that is the essence of a processor right here: you shove numbers into a processor and it outputs new ones, this is why you also come across the term "computer" because at the end, all it does is applying various computations onto a set of numbers.  

Within the processor itself numbers are a core aspect of its structure, all the parts are just numbers going in and out.  
Keep in mind that the actual nature of those numbers doesn't really matter in essence, as long as the rules are well defined. Which means that the same number may mean different things to different parts of the processor, or even different inputs of the same part.
